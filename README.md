# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

The map could filter based on search criteria as well so that it is dynamic like the table. Lastly, the filtering capabilities should be expanded so that a user could enter a date range or search multiple UFO shapes at one time.
